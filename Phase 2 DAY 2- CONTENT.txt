polymorphism:
one item or same item used for different purposes.

types:
1)overloading
   a. operator overloading
      one a same operator function is used to add two different datatypes like 1+2=3,"1"+"2"=12
   
   b. method overloading
2)over riding
characters can be transformed from parent to child
if a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base class or parent class.



DATA STRUCTURES:
1)linear DS
array,linked list,stack,queue,matrix
2)Non linear ds
binary tree,hash table,heap,graph

static:
array

dynamic:
list,stack,queues

linked list:
ex -train
as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list

creating linked list:
steps
1. create a node
2. partion the node with two segments data,none
3. add value into the blank node
4. mark the node as head
5. create the next node by following the above steps 
6. establish link between the first and second node

display linked list:
traversal is required from first node till tail node inorder to display existing linked list
